SWFTools-Core
=============

This is a SWF decompiler and basic player.  In the past this product was know as Flash Exploit and it had a pay wall for certain features.  The code has been gathering dust since 2006, so I'm pushing it onto the web for others to play with.  And for a warning, the code is old and messy, it needs better structuring and coding standards.
