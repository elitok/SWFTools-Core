SWFTools-Core
=============

This is a SWF decompiler and basic player.  In the past this product was know as Flash Exploit and it had a pay wall for certain features.  The code has been gathering dust since 2006, so I'm pushing it onto the web for others to play with.  And for a warning, the code is old and messy, it needs better structuring and coding standards.

Running the Main Program
=============

1) Setup a "working" directory and add an empty folder called "Plugins"
2) Run the class *com.mgatelabs.swftools.FlashExploitGui* and make sure you properly setup the working path.  It's also a good idea to give the program a bit more ram.

Dependencies
=============

1) None, everything was included
